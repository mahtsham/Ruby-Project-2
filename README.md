## Cloning and installation

Clone this repository to your local machine. To do this, click on the green "Code" button at the top right of list of files and copy the link in the prompt. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/mahtsham/Ruby-Project-2.git

This will create a folder called 'Ruby-Project-2' inside the directory you ran the command in.

CD into that folder:

    cd Ruby-Project-2

Then run the following command:

    bundle install

This folder contains a Gemfile, which tells bundle which gems to install locally and makes them available for use in that directory. In this case, we are installing RSpec, which is a popular Ruby testing framework.

Verify that the installation was successful by simply running the following command:

    bundle exec rspec

Which should print a few lines about not finding any examples. This is ok and means it's working!

## RSPEC
- We can check all the test cases by running rspec.
- To check we have to write rspec in the terminal.
- This will run all the test cases which are preset in spec directoy
- In spec directory there is a file named test_spec.rb which holds all the test cases
